# Frontend Test Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the frontend test suite.

## Key Improvements

1. **Created Centralized Test Utilities**
   - Added `test-utils.tsx` that provides shared test utilities
   - Centralized mock data that was previously duplicated across test files
   - Created consistent mock functions for common API calls

2. **Eliminated Custom Component Mocks**
   - Removed the custom mock of the StepsEditor component to use the actual implementation
   - Created dedicated StepsEditor tests to properly validate its functionality
   - Only kept necessary mocks for complex components like DataGrid

3. **Standardized Data Fetching**
   - Confirmed that the application consistently uses the native fetch API
   - Removed any references to alternative fetching libraries (none were found)
   - Improved fetch mocking approach with more modular and reusable patterns

4. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Eliminated duplicate mock data across test files
   - Created shared test setup/teardown patterns
   - Standardized test patterns for similar functionality

5. **Improved Test Readability**
   - Simplified tests by abstracting common testing logic
   - Made test assertions more consistent and maintainable
   - Added helper functions to make test code more reusable

## Files Changed

- Created `frontend/src/test-utils.tsx` for shared test utilities
- Refactored `MealPlanTab.test.tsx` to use shared utilities
- Refactored `App.test.tsx` to use shared utilities
- Updated `AddRecipeForm.test.tsx` to use the actual StepsEditor component
- Refactored `MealManagementTab.test.tsx` to follow consistent patterns
- Created new `StepsEditor.test.tsx` file
- Added documentation in `frontend/README.md`

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust mock server (like MSW) for more realistic API testing
2. Increase test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
3. Add more integration tests that verify component interactions
4. Implement more robust visual regression testing for UI components
